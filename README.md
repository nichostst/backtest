# Backtest

Creatively named to intelligently mask the creativity of the author. Ha, reverse psychology!

Part of my strategy backtesting framework. A combination of automatic annotation of buy/sell signals and statistical learning algorithms.
I sort of believe that cryptocurrency market is low in signal-to-noise ratio, with how erratic the prices can move, most of the times breaking
all your hypotheses. However, it serves as a good testbed for the strategies and everybody (both the wise and unwise in decision making and
their uncles and their goldfishes) is into it..

Is that a possible *alpha* source I see? :o

Footnote: I need a good data source because the performance of my models with even my steroid-injected technical indicators aren't exactly encouraging.
